\subsection{Scope}

This document describes the model that represents the situation given in the FM project specification document. The goal is to verify that in a workplace, where there are an operator and a robot moving simultaneously and manipulating objects, no collision can happen.
This model focuses on the movement part of the system, abstracting away the object manipulation as requested in the specification document.
